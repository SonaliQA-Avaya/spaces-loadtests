# Test Spaces setup in project "mongodb-zacktest"

## Validate if spaces-socket-hpa works

Found issue of socker hpa server calling "default" namespace when check pod number of "spaces-socket". But the test project is using "spacestesting" namespace.

The issue was finally fixed by getting correct namespace.

The HPA works as expected. Everything it found the active connections reached 5000, it will spin up new pods.
