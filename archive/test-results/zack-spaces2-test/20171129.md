# Test Spaces setup in project "mongodb-zacktest"

## Find out how many active connections can a "spaces-socket" pod handles

Prepare test environment:

- use artillery cluster tool with size of 10 (n1-standard-1).
- "example-cluster" has 5 nodes.
- "spaces-socket-hpa" is temoparily removed.
- "spades-socket" has one active pod.

Test command: `node run.js -- connection.yaml`

### Test 1

Test case "connection.yaml" has these variables:

- config.socketio.phases.0.uration: 1200
- config.socketio.phases.0.arrivalRate: 10
- scenarios.0.flow.1.think: 900
- ==> max connections can generate with 10 workers: 9000 * 10

Result:

- From Stackdriver monitoring, at the point of 20146 "socketio client count", the pod frozen and stopped responding.
- pod "spaces-socket-883188704-z8g05" max memory shows about 700M before frozen.
- node "gke-example-cluster-default-pool-3a87f74c-9dtj" (where pod "spaces-socket-883188704-z8g05" located) max memory shows about 2.6G before frozen.

### Test 2

Test case "connection.yaml" has these variables:

- config.socketio.phases.0.uration: 1200
- config.socketio.phases.0.arrivalRate: 10
- scenarios.0.flow.1.think: 50
- ==> max connections can generate with 10 workers: 500 * 10

Result:

- During the test, all pods/nodes looks healthy.
- max "socketio client count" shows on Stackdriver monitoring: ~ 5000
- pod "spaces-socket-883188704-3mbfn":
  + CPU: 0.9% => 48.6%
  + memory: 250M => 1.087G
  + disk: 2.357G => 2.406G
- node "gke-example-cluster-default-pool-3a87f74c-50m6":
  + CPU: 2.3% => 93.6%
  + memory: 599M => 1.81G
  + disk: 5.14G => 6.117G

### Test 3

Test case "connection.yaml" has these variables:

- config.socketio.phases.0.uration: 1200
- config.socketio.phases.0.arrivalRate: 10
- scenarios.0.flow.1.think: 100
- ==> max connections can generate with 10 workers: 1000 * 10

Result:

- During the test, all pods/nodes looks healthy.
- max "socketio client count" shows on Stackdriver monitoring: ~ 10000
- pod "spaces-socket-883188704-3mbfn":
  + CPU: 0.9% => 45.3%
  + memory: 307M => 1.3G
  + disk: 2.4G => 2.406G
- node "gke-example-cluster-default-pool-3a87f74c-50m6":
  + CPU: 2.9% => 83.3%
  + memory: 1.02M => 1.97G
  + disk: 6.11G => 6.117G
